Just set up this blog to document my building journey. I'll be sharing my experiences creating products in web services, crypto, and AI.

Why blog about it? Because building in public is fun, keeps me accountable, and hopefully helps others learn from my successes (and inevitable failures).

PS: I want to thank Claude 3.5 for it's contribution to the creation of this blog.
